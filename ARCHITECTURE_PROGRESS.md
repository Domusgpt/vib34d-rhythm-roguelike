# Architecture Refactor Progress

## Completed Work
- **Canvas lifecycle stabilisation** – Implemented `CanvasResourcePool` to preallocate per-system layer stacks, register pooled contexts with the resource manager, and coordinate resize handling so visualization swaps no longer churn the DOM or drop WebGL state.【F:src/core/CanvasManager.js†L1-L195】【F:src/core/CanvasManager.js†L197-L334】
- **Engine orchestration foundation** – Added an `EngineCoordinator` that initialises engines in order, provisions shared buffers/textures/shaders once, enforces lifecycle contracts, and relays parameter updates and broadcasts across the active system set.【F:src/core/EngineCoordinator.js†L1-L204】【F:src/core/EngineCoordinator.js†L219-L357】
- **GPU resource management** – Established a `ResourceManager` that registers contexts, tracks buffers/textures/programs, monitors memory pressure, and exposes helpers for common assets like gradients and noise fields.【F:src/core/ResourceManager.js†L1-L160】【F:src/core/ResourceManager.js†L222-L420】
- **Predictable state container** – Delivered a Redux-style `StateManager` with domain reducers, validation/persistence middleware, bounded history, and localStorage restore hooks to centralise gameplay, audio, UI, and system state.【F:src/core/StateManager.js†L1-L120】【F:src/core/StateManager.js†L224-L520】
- **Visualizer facade integration** – Refactored `VisualizerEngine` to assemble the pool/coordinator/managers, mirror audio analytics into state, route gameplay events through broadcasts, and keep visualization parameters aligned with the store.【F:src/core/VisualizerEngine.js†L1-L252】【F:src/core/VisualizerEngine.js†L264-L512】
- **Layered shader rebuild** – Replaced bespoke per-system implementations with a shared `BaseLayeredEngine` that clones shared GPU blueprints through the `ResourceManager`, renders pooled canvases with coordinated shader pipelines, and centralises audio/gameplay reactivity across all engines.【F:src/core/BaseLayeredEngine.js†L1-L409】【F:src/core/Engine.js†L1-L69】【F:src/quantum/QuantumEngine.js†L1-L75】【F:src/holograms/RealHolographicSystem.js†L1-L70】【F:src/core/PolychoraSystem.js†L1-L79】
- **Resource usage tracking** – Captured shared buffer/texture/shader ownership per engine and mapped pooled resource handles to durable IDs so the coordinator can record attachment/detachment against the ResourceManager audit trail.【F:src/core/ResourceManager.js†L220-L360】【F:src/core/EngineCoordinator.js†L1-L192】
- **Hypercube fallback integration** – Provisioned dedicated pooled canvases and refactored the hypercube visualizer to consume pooled WebGL contexts, enabling seamless mode toggles without recreating contexts.【F:src/core/CanvasManager.js†L10-L86】【F:src/visualizers/HypercubeGameSystem.js†L1-L120】【F:src/core/VisualizerEngine.js†L180-L224】
- **State persistence regression tests** – Added a headless Node harness that validates score/level reducers, subscription lifecycles, and localStorage persistence/restore flows so the state container is covered before the integration test push.【F:tests/stateManager.test.mjs†L1-L109】【F:tests/run-tests.mjs†L1-L52】

## Remaining Work Before Refactor & Testing Break
- **Engine integration smoke tests** – Build headless harness coverage for the canvas pool and engine coordinator so initialization, switching, and teardown flows are validated ahead of the testing break.【F:src/core/VisualizerEngine.js†L114-L159】【F:src/core/CanvasManager.js†L1-L195】【F:src/core/EngineCoordinator.js†L1-L204】

## Next Steps
1. Introduce minimal integration tests that exercise engine switching, state restoration, and resource cleanup to validate the refactor before pausing for the testing break.
2. Capture visual baselines for the new shader pipelines to confirm parity with the original systems before further optimisation.
